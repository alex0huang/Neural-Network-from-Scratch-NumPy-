# Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

This project implements a simple **2-layer neural network** from scratch using only NumPy.  
The goal is to classify synthetic 2D data based on the sign of the product `x1 * x2`.

## Features
- Manual forward propagation
- Binary cross-entropy loss
- Backpropagation (manual gradients)
- Weight updates with gradient descent
- Training accuracy monitoring

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
